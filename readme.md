# k8-launcher.sh Documentation

## Overview
The `k8-launcher.sh` script is designed to automate the setup and management of Kubernetes clusters. It simplifies the process of creating, deleting, and listing clusters, making it easier for users to manage their Kubernetes environments.

## Prerequisites
- **Operating System**: Linux-based
- **Permissions**: Root/sudo access
- **Software**: Docker installed and running (recommended)

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/k8-launcher.git

   ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x k8-launcher.sh
   ```

## Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: You may need to set certain environment variables depending on your setup. For example:
  ```bash
  export K8S_VERSION=1.21.0
  export CLUSTER_NAME=my-cluster
  ```

- **Configuration File**: If the script supports a configuration file, ensure it is correctly set up. Check the script's documentation for details on the configuration file format and options.

## Usage
To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
./k8-launcher.sh [options]
```

## Options
- `-h`, `--help`: Display help information about the script.
- `-v`, `--version`: Show the version of the script.
- `-c`, `--create`: Create a new Kubernetes cluster.
- `-d`, `--delete`: Delete an existing Kubernetes cluster.
- `-l`, `--list`: List all available Kubernetes clusters.

## Advanced Configuration
- **Custom Network Settings**: You can specify custom network settings by setting the `NETWORK_CONFIG` environment variable.
- **Persistent Storage**: Configure persistent storage options by editing the `storage-config.yaml` file.
- **Security Policies**: Implement custom security policies by modifying the `security-policies.yaml` file.

## Dependencies
- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and running. The script uses Docker to manage Kubernetes clusters.
- **kubectl**: The Kubernetes command-line tool should be installed for cluster management.
- **jq**: A lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor used for parsing JSON outputs.

## Examples
- **Create a new Kubernetes cluster**:
  ```bash
  ./k8-launcher.sh --create
  ```

- **Delete an existing Kubernetes cluster**:
  ```bash
  ./k8-launcher.sh --delete
  ```

- **List all available Kubernetes clusters**:
  ```bash
  ./k8-launcher.sh --list
  ```

- **Display help information**:
  ```bash
  ./k8-launcher.sh --help
  ```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with the script, ensure that:
- You have the necessary permissions (root/sudo access).
- Docker is installed and running.
- Your Linux distribution is supported by the script.
- Check the logs for any error messages and consult the script's documentation for potential solutions.
